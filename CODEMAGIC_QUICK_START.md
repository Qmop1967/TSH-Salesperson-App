## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

### **If Build Fails:**
1. Check build logs in Codemagic dashboard
2. Verify Bundle ID matches exactly: `com.tsh.salesperson`
3. Ensure App Store Connect API key has correct permissions
4. Check that app exists in App Store Connect

### **Common Issues:**
```bash
# Certificate issues:
- Verify App Store Connect API key is valid
- Check Bundle ID matches exactly
- Ensure you have Developer account (not just free Apple ID)

# Build issues:
- Check Flutter version compatibility
- Verify all dependencies are up to date
- Review build logs for specific errors
```
