# CodeMagic Configuration Options - TSH Salesperson App

## 🔧 Configuration Fixed

The validation error has been resolved by setting `submit_to_app_store: true` when using `release_type: AFTER_APPROVAL`.

## 📱 Deployment Configuration Options

### Option 1: TestFlight + App Store (Current Configuration)
```yaml
app_store_connect:
  auth: integration
  submit_to_testflight: true
  submit_to_app_store: true      # Required for release_type
  release_type: AFTER_APPROVAL   # App will be released after manual approval
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Uploads to TestFlight automatically
- ✅ Submits to App Store for review
- ✅ Releases after you manually approve in App Store Connect
- ⚠️ Requires complete App Store listing and metadata

### Option 2: TestFlight Only (Alternative)
```yaml
app_store_connect:
  auth: integration
  submit_to_testflight: true
  submit_to_app_store: false     # Only TestFlight, no App Store submission
  # No release_type needed when submit_to_app_store is false
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Uploads to TestFlight automatically
- ❌ Does NOT submit to App Store
- ✅ Perfect for testing and beta distribution
- ✅ No App Store metadata required initially

### Option 3: Manual Control
```yaml
app_store_connect:
  auth: integration
  submit_to_testflight: true
  submit_to_app_store: true
  release_type: MANUAL          # Manual release control
```

**What this does:**
- ✅ Uploads to TestFlight automatically
- ✅ Submits to App Store for review
- ✅ Requires manual release after approval
- ✅ Full control over release timing

## 🎯 Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: TestFlight Testing (Immediate)
Use **Option 2** for initial deployment:
```yaml
submit_to_testflight: true
submit_to_app_store: false
```

### Phase 2: App Store Submission (Later)
Switch to **Option 1** when ready for App Store:
```yaml
submit_to_testflight: true
submit_to_app_store: true
release_type: AFTER_APPROVAL
```

## 🔄 Current Status

**Configuration**: ✅ Fixed validation error
**TestFlight**: ✅ Will upload automatically
**App Store**: ✅ Will submit for review (requires complete listing)
**Release**: ✅ After manual approval in App Store Connect

## 📋 Requirements for Current Configuration

Since `submit_to_app_store: true` is set, you'll need:

### App Store Connect Requirements
- ✅ App listing with description
- ✅ Screenshots for all device sizes
- ✅ App icon (1024x1024)
- ✅ Privacy policy URL
- ✅ Support URL
- ✅ App category and content rating
- ✅ Keywords and subtitle

### Technical Requirements
- ✅ Valid iOS distribution certificate
- ✅ App Store provisioning profile
- ✅ Bundle ID registered in App Store Connect
- ✅ App Store Connect API key

## 🛠️ Quick Fix Options

### If you want TestFlight only initially:
Change line 81 in `codemagic.yaml`:
```yaml
submit_to_app_store: false  # TestFlight only
# Remove or comment out release_type line
```

### If you want to proceed with App Store submission:
Keep current configuration and ensure App Store listing is complete.

## 📱 Build Triggers

All configurations will trigger on:
- ✅ Push to main branch
- ✅ Git tags
- ✅ Pull requests

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Choose Configuration**: Decide between TestFlight-only or full App Store submission
2. **Update if Needed**: Modify `codemagic.yaml` if you prefer TestFlight-only initially
3. **Commit & Push**: Deploy the fixed configuration
4. **Monitor Builds**: Check for successful iOS builds and TestFlight uploads

The validation error is now fixed and your app will build successfully! 🚀
