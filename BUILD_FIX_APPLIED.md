# 🔧 iOS Build Fix Applied

## ❌ Problem:
Build #8 failed with error:
```
No matching profiles found for bundle identifier "com.tsh.sales.tsh_salesperson_app" and distribution type "app_store"
```

## ✅ Solution Applied:

### 1. Updated CodeMagic Configuration
**Changed iOS signing from manual to automatic:**
- Added `xcode_project: ios/Runner.xcodeproj`
- Added `xcode_scheme: Runner`
- This tells CodeMagic to use automatic signing with your Apple Developer account

### 2. Updated ExportOptions.plist
**Switched from manual to automatic signing:**
- Changed `signingStyle` from `manual` to `automatic`
- Removed manual provisioning profile references
- Kept your Team ID: `38U844SAJ5`

### 3. Why This Fixes the Issue:
- **Automatic signing** lets Xcode/CodeMagic automatically create and manage provisioning profiles
- **No need** to manually create/upload provisioning profiles
- **Simpler** and more reliable for CI/CD builds

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### Test the Fix:
1. **Create a new tag** to trigger another build:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.2
   git push origin v1.0.2
   ```

2. **Or push to main branch** to trigger production workflow

### Expected Results:
- ✅ iOS signing should work automatically
- ✅ IPA file should be generated successfully
- ✅ Upload to TestFlight should complete
- ✅ Build should pass without provisioning profile errors

## 📋 What Changed:

### codemagic.yaml:
```yaml
ios_signing:
  distribution_type: app_store
  bundle_identifier: com.tsh.sales.tsh_salesperson_app
  xcode_project: ios/Runner.xcodeproj  # ← Added
  xcode_scheme: Runner                 # ← Added
```

### ios/ExportOptions.plist:
```xml
<key>signingStyle</key>
<string>automatic</string>  <!-- Changed from manual -->
```

## 🎯 Benefits of Automatic Signing:
- ✅ No manual provisioning profile management
- ✅ Automatic certificate renewal
- ✅ Simpler CI/CD setup
- ✅ Less maintenance required
- ✅ Works with your Apple Developer account automatically
