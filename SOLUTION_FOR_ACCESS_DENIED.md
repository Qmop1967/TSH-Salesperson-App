# ðŸ”§ Solution for "Access Denied" Error

Based on your screenshot, I can see the Odoo database manager with an "Access Denied" error when trying to backup. Here are the solutions:

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution 1: Set Master Password (Recommended)

I notice there's a **"Set Master Password"** button in your interface. This suggests no master password is currently set.

### Steps:
1. **Click "Set Master Password"** button
2. **Enter a new master password** (e.g., `Zcbm.97531Tsh` or something you prefer)
3. **Confirm the password**
4. **Try the backup again**

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution 2: Use the Duplicate Button

I can see a **"Duplicate"** button next to your database. This might work even without a master password:

### Steps:
1. **Click "Duplicate"** button next to `odtshbrain`
2. **Enter new database name**: `odtshbrain_test`
3. **This should create a copy directly**

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution 3: Alternative Backup Methods

If the above don't work, try these alternatives:

### Method A: Export Data Instead of Full Backup
1. **Login to your Odoo database** normally
2. **Go to Settings > Technical > Database Structure > Export**
3. **Export specific modules/data** instead of full database

### Method B: Contact System Administrator
- **Ask them to set the master password**
- **Request they create the test database for you**
- **Get proper database management permissions**

## ðŸš€ Quick Test Script

Let me create a script to test the duplicate function:
