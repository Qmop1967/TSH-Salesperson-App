## ü§ñ Automated Deployment Process

Your Codemagic configuration will automatically:

### Development Builds (`develop` branch)
- Build debug APK
- Run tests and code analysis
- Email results to `kha89ahm@gmail.com`

### Production Builds (`main` branch or version tags)
- Build release AAB (Android App Bundle)
- Sign with your keystore
- Upload to Google Play Store (Internal Testing track)
- Send email notification with store link

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Internal Testing
```bash
# Create and push version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```
- Codemagic builds and uploads to Internal Testing
- Test with up to 100 internal testers
- Fix any issues and iterate

### Phase 2: Closed Testing (Alpha)
- Promote from Internal Testing
- Test with limited external users
- Gather feedback and improve

### Phase 3: Open Testing (Beta)
- Open to public beta testers
- Collect reviews and ratings
- Final polishing

### Phase 4: Production Release
- Promote to Production track
- Staged rollout: 10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%
- Monitor crash reports and reviews

## üì± Quick Start Commands

### Build and Deploy to Internal Testing
```bash
# Ensure you're on main branch
git checkout main

# Create version tag
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# Codemagic will automatically:
# 1. Build release AAB
# 2. Sign with keystore
# 3. Upload to Google Play Internal Testing

- **Vitals**: Crash reports, ANRs, performance
- **User Feedback**: Reviews and ratings
- **Financial**: Revenue reports (if paid app)

### Codemagic Dashboard
- **Build History**: All deployments tracked
- **Artifacts**: Download AAB/APK files
- **Logs**: Detailed build and deployment logs
- **Notifications**: Email alerts for all builds

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Service Account Permission Error
```
Error: The service account does not have permission
```
**Solution**: Ensure service account has "Release manager" role in Play Console

#### 2. Package Name Conflict
```
Error: Package name already exists
```
**Solution**: Your package name `com.tsh.sales.tsh_salesperson_app` should be unique
